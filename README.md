# Nessus-Credentialed-Vulnerability-Scan
Using Nessus Essentials to discover and remediate vulnerabilities on a local VM hosted on VMWare Workstation

## Objective

_**Technologies used**: Virtual Machines, Nessus Essentials, Active Directory 

In this lab, I created a vulnerable virtual machine and deployed it to the public internet to serve as a honeypot. I then ingested logs regarding failed remote login attempts Into Azure using Azure's **Log Analytics Workspace** service. Finally, I used **Azure Sentinel** to process the logs and plot a heatmap of the attackers' locations on a world map to visualize where the attacks were coming from.

Below, I've documented a comprehensive outline detailing a three-stage process. The following step-by-step guide is designed to facilitate seamless progression from start to finish.
