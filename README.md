## Project Overview

_**Technologies used**: Virtual Machines, Nessus Essentials, Windows Active Directory Domain, VMs of Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10_

In this lab, I configured a **Windows Active Directory Domain** and ran credentialed vulnerability scans on local virtual machines running **VMware Workstation** using **Nessus Essentials**. The goal was to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of them, and then carry out verification rescans to verify successful remediation were the objectives.Â 

Below, I've included a thorough outline of the step-by-step process of this project. By following this outline, you should smoothly be able to complete this project from beginning to end.
