# Nessus-Credentialed-Vulnerability-Scan
Using Nessus Essentials to discover and remediate vulnerabilities on a local VM hosted on VMWare Workstation

## Project Overview

**Technologies used**: Virtual Machines, Nessus Essentials, Windows Active Directory Domain, VM's of Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10

In this lab, I configured a **Windows Active Directory Domain** and ran credentialed vulnerability scans on local virtual machines running **VMware Workstation** using **Nessus Essentials**. The goal was to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of them, and then carry out verification rescans to verify successful remediation were the objectives.Â 
 

to discover vulnerabilities   I then ingested logs regarding failed remote login attempts Into Azure using Azure's **Log Analytics Workspace** service. Finally, I used **Azure Sentinel** to process the logs and plot a heatmap of the attackers' locations on a world map to visualize where the attacks were coming from.

Below, I've documented a comprehensive outline detailing a three-stage process. The following step-by-step guide is designed to facilitate seamless progression from start to finish.
